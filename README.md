### This project aims to tackle the challenges of data warehouse modeling and ETL pipeline creation. We have multiple data sources in CSV format containing information about a South American e-commerce website. The objective is to develop an automated data pipeline that retrieves these data sources, transforms the data as required, and loads it into a data warehouse, providing structured and relevant business information. The pipeline is scheduled to run routinely, automates data integration and ensures a reliable solution for the business.

### Tools used :
### Visual Studio Enterprise 2022 (version 17.11.4) with SSIS - SQL Server Integration Services addon.
### SQL Server Management Studio 20 (version 20.2)
### Windows Server Datacenter 2022 (version 21H2)

### Source files: 
### Datasets contain information about customer purchases made across a variety of sellers on a marketplace. The data spans multiple years and includes details such as order status, payment methods, freight information, customer locations, and product reviews. The dataset is divided into multiple tables to allow for the exploration of different aspects of the order lifecycle.
